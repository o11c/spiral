Usage:
    Optionally, edit ./config.h for the best experience on your platform.

    make
    bin/super [args...]

    The arguments are pass exactly as if typed after the program starts.
    ./super4 is a wrapper script that you probably want to always use.

    All of the geometry parameters are dynamically controlled;
    you may alter them by pressing keys. Lighting is hard-coded, however.

    Lowercase makes it smaller, uppercase makes it bigger.

    Click and drag to change the view angle, and scroll to zoom.

    Also there are some special keys.

Keys:
    0: reset everything except the 2,3,4 toggles
    2: toggle display of the mesh.
    3: toggle display of the shaded thing.
    4: toggle textures
    8, 9: toggle display of each component of the mesh.

    d, D: adjust torus radius
    p, P: adjust warp
    q, Q: adjust warp

    n, N: adjust mesh resolution.
    m, M: adjust mesh resolution.

    e, E: adjust shininess exponent.

    t: toggle sphere vs torus
    a: toggle q correction

Bugs:
    Something is wrong with the depth if you zoom in too much.

    Something is wrong with the BMP reader. The images I originally
    downloaded loaded, but with the wrong offset. This looks like
    the BMP reader is not properly handling the "header length" set
    in some BMP versions.

    This code is somewhat stressful to compilers. To see if yours works,
    check the buildbot results: https://travis-ci.org/o11c/spiral

    Currently, gcc 4.6+ and clang 3.2+ seem to work.
