Usage:
    Optionally, edit ./config.h for the best experience on your platform.

    make
    bin/spiral0 [args...]

    The arguments are pass exactly as if typed after the program starts.
    ./spiral1, ./spiral2, and ./spiral3 are wrapper scripts that give
    the keys as required for the assignment.

    All of the geometry parameters are dynamically controlled;
    you may alter them by pressing keys. Lighting is hard-coded, however.

    Lowercase makes it smaller, uppercase makes it bigger.

    Click and drag to change the view angle, and scroll to zoom.

    Also there are some special keys.

Keys:
    0: reset everything except the 1,2,3 toggles
    1: toggle display of the spine curve.
    2: toggle display of the mesh.
    3: toggle display of the shaded thing.
    8, 9: toggle display of each component of the mesh.

    a, A: adjust torus major radius.
    b, B: adjust torus minor radius.
    r, R: adjust tube radius.
    s, S: adjust tube second radius.

    p, P: adjust number of circuits.
    q, Q: adjust number of wraps.

    n, N: adjust spine resolution. Note that this is modified by p and q.
    m, M: adjust tube resolution.

    e, E: adjust shininess exponent.

Bugs:
    Something is wrong with the depth if you zoom in too much.
    Certain small values of N cause kinks.

    This code is somewhat stressful to compilers. To see if yours works,
    check the buildbot results: https://travis-ci.org/o11c/spiral

    Currently, gcc 4.6+ and clang 3.2+ seem to work.
